# Tiled Collider

> `using HarpEngine.Tiles`

The `TiledCollider` was created with platforming in mind. It can be used alongside tiled areas to query for specific types of collisions most useful for platforming. Primarily, inner collisions and side collisions.

The `TiledCollider` must be updated before making collision checks.
